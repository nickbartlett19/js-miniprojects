For the game itself, I'm thinking of a classic fantasy trope. An evil Wizard
has kidnapped a princess, and a knight has to rescue her from his tower.

Names
Wizard - Galtha
Princess - Meriea
Knight - Sir Lancard
King - Alfred

Each GameStage block will have three components: a description, speech/prompt, and 
a question - what will you do?
