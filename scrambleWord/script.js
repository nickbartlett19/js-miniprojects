// Make a game (with a browser UI or TUI) that scrambles the letters in a word and asks the player to guess the original word. Good for developing skills with manipulating strings, getting a feel for a few different data structures, working with events, and storing state (especially if you make a CSS/HTML version).

// Additional challenges:

// Difficulty selector (e.g. easy, medium, hard)
// Persist high scores/other records in a DB (or however you want to)
// Ensure that the player never gets the same word twice in a single game.
